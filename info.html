            <h1>Studio Gruhl's identity for techno label Spellbound is really a canvas primed to grow and change</h1>

        <div class="info-body">
            <p>When Studio Gruhl was invited to design the identity for the young female-led techno label Spellbound, they realised they had a lot of room to play. As Creative Director Malte Gruhl puts it, younger brands are always fun to work with; there are fewer corporate hoops to jump through and there's also an appetite for bending the traditional rules of branding, allowing designers to crack something truly unique and fresh.</p>
            <p>And that's exactly how things turned out for Studio Gruhl and Spellbound â€“ the final identity is chockablock with character; it asks for your attention and stamps its presence.</p>
